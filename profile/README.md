## Onboarding process for students

### GitHub access

First, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to join the organization.

> [!CAUTION]
> ***DO NOT*** create a GitHub account _exclusively_ with your school email address. Once you graduate, _you will lose access to that email address_.  This will mean your GitHub account may not be recoverable!
> 
> If you created your GitHub account with your school email, you can transfer it to a different email following [these](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address) instructions.

Once you have created an account for GitHub, verify it with your email and let a mentor or a programmer already in the organization know so they can invite you.

### Programming tooling and installs

Install [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) <sup>Windows Only</sup> from National Instruments

If you want some extra nice things to install (totally not required but helpful), you can install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download/) and [Java 17 (JDK)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jdk)

More detailed instructions to install your tools will be upcoming soon<sup>tm</sup>.
